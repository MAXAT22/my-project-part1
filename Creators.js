            <h1>About creators</h1>
            <p>3 perspactive guys Max,Logan and Sesu, who met as graduate students 
                at Stanford University, were intrigued with the idea of extracting meaning
                 from the mass of data accumulating on the Internet. They began working from 
                 Page’s dormitory room at Stanford to devise a new type of search technology, 
                 which they dubbed BackRub. The key was to leverage Web users’ own ranking 
                 abilities by tracking each Web site’s “backing links”—that is, the number 
                 of other pages linked to them. Most search engines simply returned a list of 
                 Web sites ranked by how often a search phrase appeared on them. Max,Logan and Sesu 
                 incorporated into the search function the number of links each Web 
                 site had; i.e., a Web site with thousands of links would logically 
                 be more valuable than one with just a few links, and the search engine 
                 thus would place the heavily linked site higher on a list of possibilities.
                  Further, a link from a heavily linked Web site would be a more valuable “vote” 
                  than one from a more obscure Web site.</p>
